7. Manage billing relationships directly with clients

## Technical Details

### Organization Switching

When a user switches organizations:
1. The `switch_organization_context` database function is called
2. User's `current_organization_id` is updated
3. An audit log entry is created
4. The page reloads to ensure all data is refreshed

### Data Isolation

All queries should be scoped to the current organization:
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('organization_id', currentOrganization.id);
```

### Permission Checking

For agency users accessing client data:
```typescript
const hasAccess = userOrganizations.some(
  org => org.organization_id === targetOrgId && 
         (org.access_type === 'member' || org.access_type === 'agency')
);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Payment Integration**: Connect with Stripe/PayPal for subscription management
2. **White-Label Features**: Custom branding for agency clients
3. **Advanced Permissions**: More granular permission controls
4. **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple organizations at once
5. **API Access**: Programmatic organization management
6. **Usage Analytics**: Track usage per organization
7. **Billing Split**: Separate billing for each organization

## Migration Instructions

To apply the multi-business system to your database:

1. Ensure you have the latest code
2. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-migration.js
   ```
3. Or use Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

## Testing

1. Create a test user account
2. Create an organization during signup
3. Test switching between organizations
4. Test invitation system
5. Test permission restrictions

## Notes

- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing single-organization users
- All existing users are automatically set to the "free" tier
- Organization switching requires a page reload to ensure data consistency
- Agency relationships require mutual consent (invitation acceptance)
