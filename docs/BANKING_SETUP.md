# Banking App Setup Guide

Your banking app is ready to go! Here's how to complete the setup:

## 🏗️ Database Setup (Required)

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250122000002_create_banking_tables.sql`
4. Paste and **Run** the SQL script

### Option 2: Via Supabase CLI
If you have Supabase CLI installed and linked:
```bash
# Link your project (if not already linked)
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push migrations to remote database
npx supabase db push
```

## 🎯 What the Migration Creates

The banking system includes these tables:
- `bank_accounts` - Store business bank accounts
- `bank_transactions` - Track all account transactions  
- `payment_methods` - Manage payment cards/methods
- `scheduled_payments` - Handle recurring payments

All tables include:
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ User isolation (users only see their own data)
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance
- ✅ Automatic timestamp management

## 🚀 Testing with Demo Data

After creating the tables, add sample data for testing:

1. **Start your app** and login
2. **Run the demo data script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-banking-demo-data.js
   ```

This will create:
- 3 sample bank accounts (checking, savings, loan)
- 5 recent transactions
- 2 payment methods  
- 2 scheduled payments
