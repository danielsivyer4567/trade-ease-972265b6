# AutoFix Rule

- Always apply automatically from AI suggestions or instructions
- Automatically accept fixes for "Cannot find module" errors
- Auto-fix import path issues for React components
- Auto-accept route configuration changes and fixes
- Auto-fix navigation and workflow related components
- For TypeScript issues, prefer to fix with proper type definitions rather than any/unknown types
