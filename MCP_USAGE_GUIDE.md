# How to Use MCP Commands with Claude Desktop

## üöÄ **Setup Complete - Now Use MCP Commands!**

Once your MCP server is connected to Claude Desktop, you can use powerful commands directly in your **normal chat conversation**.

## üìç **Where to Use Commands**

### **Location: Claude Desktop Chat Interface**
- Open Claude Desktop application
- Start a **new conversation** or continue an existing one
- Type commands directly in the **chat input box** (same place you're typing now!)

## üí¨ **Example MCP Commands You Can Use**

### **File System Commands**
```
Show me the contents of src/components/
```

```
Read the file src/App.tsx
```

```
List all TypeScript files in the project
```

```
Search for "authentication" in the codebase
```

### **Trade Ease Specific Commands**
```
Find all customer management components
```

```
Show me the database schema
```

```
List all API endpoints in the project
```

```
Find components that use Supabase
```

### **Development Commands**
```
Show me all files modified in the last week
```

```
Find components with TypeScript errors
```

```
List all routes in the application
```

## üîß **How MCP Commands Work**

1. **Type naturally** - No special syntax needed
2. **Commands execute automatically** - Claude understands your intent
3. **Get real-time results** - Direct access to your project files
4. **Interactive responses** - Ask follow-up questions about the results

## ‚úÖ **Test Your Setup**

Try these simple commands in Claude Desktop:

1. `List the main directories in my Trade Ease project`
2. `Show me the package.json file`
3. `Find all React components in the src folder`

## üéØ **Pro Tips**

- **Be specific**: "Show me the authentication components" works better than "show files"
- **Ask follow-ups**: "Now explain how this component works"
- **Combine requests**: "Find the login component and explain its props"

## üö® **If Commands Don't Work**

1. **Check configuration**: Ensure `claude_desktop_config.json` is in the right location
2. **Restart Claude Desktop** after adding the configuration
3. **Verify paths**: Make sure the paths in the config file are correct

**Remember: MCP commands work in your normal Claude Desktop chat - no special interface needed!**
